Memory layout will be 0 0 A B TA TB A B TA TB ...
The A and B cells will store digits of the numbers A and B.
The TA and TB cells tell us how far the number goes, because
a digit might be 0, in which case the corresponding A/B cell
ends up with the value 0, and thus cannot be used to check
for the presence of a digit.
The two zeroes on the left are the landing cells for when
we are at the end of some number A/B and use the consecutive TA/TBs
to come back to the beginning.
Uses ideas seen in brainfuck.org/fib_explained.b.
This program performs ~400 instructions per character of output
    when the numbers are approximately of the same size.

  [<------>-] remove an extra 36 from the digit

 Memory layout here is either all zeroes or DA 0 1 (0) A

Now check if A is longer than B
At this point the pointer is at an empty B
so if the TA immediately to the right is set to 1
then A is longer than B
>
[ while A ends to the right of B
 <<< jump to first TB
 now we will move B one position to the right
 [ while we are at a TB
  <<[>>>>+<<<<-]
  >>>>>>+ set the TB to the right of the copied digit
  <<<<<<<< look for the next TB
 ]
 We are at the left of the tape
 Now we have to trace all the way back to the right end of B
 >>>>[>>>>]
 This is the first TB position that is not 1 because B is not that big
 < point to the neighbour TA to check if A is this big again
]

Now we are at a TA that is 0 meaning A did not expand this far
However we might be far from A if B is much longer
We use B to go to LB and from there find the end of A
<<<[<<<<] reach LB
>>>[>>>>]
Now we are at the first empty TA
If the TB to the right is 1 then B is larger than A and we push A to the right
>[               while B ends to the right of A
 <<<<<           jump to first TA
 [               while we are at a TA
  <<[>>>>+<<<<-] copy A
  >>>>>>+        set TA to the right of the copied digit
  <<<<<<<<       go to next TA
 ]
 >>>>[>>>>]
 We arrived at the first TA position that is empty
 This means A is not this long
 We check if B is this long and keep pushing A if needed

This is an empty TB and the numbers are aligned
We can start summing them now
<<<<
[                while we are at a TB
                 set TA to A plus B
 <[-]            clean TA
 <[>+<-]         copy B to TA
 <[>>+<<-]       add A to TA
 >>              prepare to move TA back to B
                 check if B is larger than 9 to carry
 [<+>-[<+>-[<+>-[<+>-[<+>-[<+>-[<+>-[<+>-[<+>-
 [               if we enter this then TA is 10 or more
  <<<<<+         in this case we need to carry one into the next B
  >>+>>          when coming back we ensure the TB is set
                 just in case this was THE MOST significant digit of the sum
  [-]            erase the current value in B to reset the units digit
