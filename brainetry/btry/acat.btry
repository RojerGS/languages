This Brainetry program takes some input
and then proceeds to outputting much like cat.
Except for
one small teeny weeny little detail:
It uses an operator that is unique to Brainetry.

The empty line operator, whose purpose is to
reset the tape pointer to the beginning.
Lovely, right?
Some day I'll use it for the greater good.
